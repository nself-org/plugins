// Purpose: regression test for siege-security-http-defaultclient-no-timeout
// (Finding #15, reopened 2026-08-31) — proves emitEvent's HTTP POST to
// NSELF_CI_EVENT_SINK is bounded by a real deadline and does not hang
// indefinitely against a stalled remote, now that the call site was migrated
// off http.DefaultClient.Do onto httptimeout.Default.Do (which still respects
// the request's own 5s context deadline set in emitEvent).
// Inputs:  a deliberately-hanging httptest.Server (blocks until test cleanup).
// Outputs: assertion that emitEvent returns within a bounded wall-clock window.
// Constraints: no network access; server-local only.

// TestEmitEventHangingServerTimesOut points NSELF_CI_EVENT_SINK at a server
// that never responds and asserts emitEvent returns (does not block forever)
// within a bounded window close to its configured 5s context deadline —
// proving the http.DefaultClient.Do -> httptimeout.Default.Do migration
// preserved the existing timeout behavior instead of silently disabling it.
