// Purpose: the check that catches the specific failure mode that hid for
//   hours on 2026-09-11 — `npx playwright install chromium` (the fallback
//   path when `--with-deps` fails because sudo needs a terminal) downloads
//   a Chromium binary with none of its shared libraries, so the browser
//   crashes with `chrome: error while loading shared libraries:
//   libnspr4.so`, which Playwright then reports as the generic, misleading
//   "Target page, context or browser has been closed". Running `ldd` on
//   any cached Chromium and grepping for "not found" catches this directly
//   instead of waiting for a job to hit it.
// Inputs:  Manifest.ChromiumCacheGlobs (home-relative glob patterns) and an
//   Executor.
// Outputs: one CheckResult per cached Chromium/headless-shell binary found
//   across every home directory on the host, plus a single StatusWarn
//   result when none is cached yet (not itself a failure — Playwright may
//   simply never have run there).
// Constraints: expansion happens in the remote/local shell (bash globbing
//   with nullglob), not in Go, because Executor has no directory-listing
//   primitive of its own and adding one would duplicate what the shell
//   already does correctly.
