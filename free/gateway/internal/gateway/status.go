// Package gateway provides client utilities for nself-ai-gateway (port 3761).
//
// Purpose: Wrap HTTP calls to nself-ai-gateway, nself-ai-cc, and nself-ai-mcp
//
//	for use in CLI gateway commands.
//
// Inputs: Port constants from internal/ports; JWT from internal/auth.
// Outputs: Typed structs for keys, quota, routes, service health.
// Constraints: Key material never returned in any output type. Moved
// verbatim from cli/internal/gateway under CLI-R11 (only used by the
// extracted `nself gateway` command family — no other core file imported
// it); its own internal/ports dependency was narrowed to a three-constant
// local copy since cli/internal/ports is unreachable from this module.
// SPORT: F02 — nself gateway command group.
