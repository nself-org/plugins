// Package commands — server.go
//
// `nself infra server` closes CLI gap G-011: provisioning, resizing, and
// destroying a server had no CLI surface, so an operator building a new CI
// box or tearing one down had to fall back to raw `hcloud server create` /
// `hcloud server delete` — neither expressible through nself, and neither
// carrying the safety checks below. This is distinct from `nself access`
// (SSH keys on an already-deployed server) and `nself security` (auditing
// one), both of which assume the server already exists.

var serverCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "server",
	Short: "Provision, list, resize, and destroy Hetzner Cloud servers",
	Long: `Manage the lifecycle of a Hetzner Cloud server: create one, list what
exists, resize one, or destroy one.

Subcommands:
  nself infra server provision   Create a new server
  nself infra server list        List servers in the project
  nself infra server resize      Change a server's type (CPU/RAM/disk)
  nself infra server destroy     Delete a server

destroy is safe by default:
  - refuses to run without a verified backup (--snapshot or --force-no-backup)
  - protects the server's primary IP(s) from auto-deletion unless --release-ip
    is passed

resize refuses (with an explanation) to shrink a server's disk — Hetzner
Cloud has no API for that; the only path is snapshot -> new server -> restore.

A Hetzner Cloud API token is required: set HETZNER_NSELF_TOKEN (or a
project-scoped equivalent via --token-env, or HCLOUD_TOKEN) in the
environment, or pass --token explicitly. The token is never logged.`,
